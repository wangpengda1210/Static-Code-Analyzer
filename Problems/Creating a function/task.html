<h2>Creating a function</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Now, it's time to create your own function in the shell. Take the function <code class="java">my_sqrt()</code> from the theory part as an example and change it so that it returns the result of <code class="java">math.sqrt()</code> for integers and floats, the string <code class="java">"The string should be converted into a numeric data type"</code> if the passed argument was a string, and <code class="java">None</code> for other inputs. </p> 
  <p>You can test this function in the shell until it works fine, then copy it into the field below, and we'll see if it is correct. Note that you shouldn't PRINT anything, just <strong>RETURN</strong> the correct values.</p>
