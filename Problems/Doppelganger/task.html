  <p>Create a program that calculates how many objects in the list <code class="java">object_list</code> have the same hash value as some other element in the list. You should <strong>print</strong> the number of those objects. If there are no matching hash values, the output should be 0.</p> 
  <p>For example, if <code class="java">object_list = [1, 397, 27468, -95, 1309, 397, -539874, -240767, -95, 397]</code>, the output should be 5.</p> 
  <p>Keep in mind that not every object in the list may be hashable!</p>
